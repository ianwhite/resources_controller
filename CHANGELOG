= 2.1.0

  * Gemify resources_controller and friends (thanks Josh Goebel)
    gem name is `rc_rails`, see also `response_for_rails`, and `response_for_rc_rails`
  * Remove Ardes namespace (BC preserved)

= Prior to gem release

* Make overriding ResourceMethods more sane.  Thanks to Tom Stuart for the nudge.

* upgraded to Rails 3 and RSpec 2. Thanks to Andrew Bloomgarden for making this happen.

  No BC with rails 2 - use the 2-3-stable branch for that.

* added ResourceMethods#destroy_resource, which calls destroy on the resource_service, which in turn finds the best way to 
  destroy the resource to trigger any association callbacks.  Changed actions to use the destroy_resource method. (reported by Jason Lee)
  
  NOTE: this may break some of your controller specs, they may report an unexpected :destroy message sent to an association.  
        You just need to expect this to happen when you have an enclosing resource.

* ResourceMethods#new_resource looks in params[singular_resource_class_name] for attributes, which makes RC much
  more compatible with form_for (reported by Jason Lee)

* resource_service.new now calls #build if the service is an association, or #new otherwise (reported by Jason Lee)

  NOTE: this may break some of your specs if you are expecting, say, a POST action to call :new on an association.
        You just need to change the mocks to expect :build (when there's an enclosing resource, and resource_service.new is called)

* resource methods (new_resource, find_resource, and find_resources) are now in a mixin so it's easier
  to override them.  Just include a new mixin after the resources_controller_for call, or add them to your
  action module.

* Allow new_resource to use the block initialisation syntax in rails 2.3 (reported by Chris Hapgood)

* Fix bug where id is the same name as the resource name [mocoso]

* Bugs introduced with RequestPathIntrospection (#5 and #6 on lighthouse) solved thanks to Sergei Serdyuk

* RC no longer uses the route that invoked the controller to figure out wildcard enclosing resources.

  - this change means that you will no longer get those pesky 'NoRecognizedRoute' errors when your controller
    is invoked by another route, such as a :controller/:action/:id route.

* Further relaxed RC's route pickiness.  If a route is not recognised, construct segments from the params

* Relaxed RC's pickiness about what route was used to invoke a controller.

* Removed deprecation warning from save_resource, and added cautionary notes to the comments instead

* If you use your own Action modules, you can now define a module method #include_actions to do the :only / :except 
  handling yourself.  See Ardes::ResourcesController::IncludeActions.  This change is completely BC, you don't need 
  to do anything to any of your existing action modules. 

* use add_enclosing_resource to add your own enclosing resources if you're skipping load_enclosing_resources [Tom Stuart, Joel Chippindale]

* The reason for the reversion in c21f35c has been fixed.  Thanks Jason Lee for the bug report.

  The problem was that I had changed resource_saved?'s behaviour to *not* saving the model if it had
  already been saved.  In the future resource_saved? will be deprecated, but not yet.

  BTW.  All of these changes to resource_saved? behaviour is aimed at making RC drop in compatible with
  rspec's generated controller specs (try rake spec:generate).
  
  To do that I need the default update action to use :update. This meant that the old strategy
  of keeping track of saves by using save_resource won't work.  Instead, we keep track by looking at the
  AR's state (see lib/ardes/active_record/saved.rb) which is a far better solution anyway.

* API change: save_resource deprecated

  So save_resource is now deprecated, just use resource.save
  ActiveRecords can now be asked if they are saved?
    
* rspec compat:  Added new rake task to test that an RC controller passes the default rspec_scaffold
  controller specs.

* Added BC for 2-0-stable branch re: find_filter, and regression specs

* find_filter no longer exists in edge - updated accordingly [Jason Lee http://github.com/jlsync]

* Added ability to pass options to named route in form_for_resource

   form_for_resource :url_options => {:gday => 'mate'}
   
   # => action="/products/1?gday=mate"  (for update)
   # => action="/products?gday=mate"    (for create)

* changed :erp to :resource_path, and added :resource_method.

  This means you can connect a named route up with a REST action and also change the method
  
  map.activate_account '/activate/:code', :controller => 'activations', :action => 'create', :resource_path => '/activations', :resource_method => :post
  
  :erp retained for BC

* save_resource and resource_saved? added.  These simply save the resource and cache
  the result of that save.  This means you can use the result of the resource save in your
  response_for blocks (if you're using response_for)
  
  response_for :create do |format|
    if resource_saved?
      format.html {}
    else
      format.html {}
    end
  end
  
  def create
    self.resource = new_resource
    save_resource
  end

* added Ardes::ResourcesController.actions and
  Ardes::ResourcesController.singleton_actions accessors so you can set the
  default actions module across your app

* Added resource_saved? method to controller.  This is useful for sharing the
  result of a save outside action methods (for example in response_for blocks)

* added error_messages_for_resource to Helper

* fixed form_for_resource when resource is new and controller is for singleton 
  resource

* added :erp patch, doc and specs [thanks Chris Hapgood for the initial patch]

  Use the :erp param when you are routing a non RESTful route to your rc controller
  This allows rc to load the resources using the route.
  
  e.g. map.home '', :controller => 'forums', :action => 'index', :erp => '/forums'

* Removed deprecated options (in r492 - I forgot to say so)

* Coverage back to 100%

* you can alias an enclosing resource with :as

  This can be useful when you have a tree like domain:
  
    map.resources :categories do |category|
      category.resources :categories
    end
  
    class CategoriesController < ApplicationController
      resources_controller_for :categories
      map_resource :category, :as => :parent
    end

* you can now specify which actions are loaded from the actions module
  
    resources_controller_for :forums, :only => [:index, :show]
    resources_controller_for :forums, :actions => MyActions, :except => :destroy
    
  The method used to achieve this is Ardes::ResourcesController::include_actions
  which can be used in any ActionController when resources_controller is in your
  plugins directory

* - :polymorphic => true is back:
      resources_controller_for :tags
      nested_in :taggable, :polymorphic => true

    This will load the enclosing resource (which can be a mapped resource) as
    @taggable as well as its default name
  
    The following syntax is equivalent to the above two lines:
      resources_controller_for :tags, :in => '?taggable'
  
    And you can specify a single wildcard '?' as well as expanding wildcards '*':
      resources_controller_for :images, :in => '?', :load_enclosing => false
      # this will work for routes like /users/1/images, /forums/2/images, /featured/images
  
  - test coverage is up
  
  - moved some of the 'friend' functionality out of Specification, as it smelt bad

* added specs for when you want to find_by_(something other than id) (users,
  addresses, interests)
  
  Fixed a bug where the resource mapping was using name instead of segment to
  match when a map should be used (this meant mapping didn't work for non 
  singleton resources)
  
  Thanks to Inviz <invi...@gmail.com> and Matt Mower <matt.mo...@gmail.com> 
  in http://groups.google.com/group/resources_controller/browse_thread/thread/b71b2ce196a09d15
  for the bug reports
    
* Updated actions to be more in line with recent rails scaffold [Jason Lee <jlsync@gmail.com>]

* resources_controller now uses before_filter (instead of prepend_before_filter)
  for load_enclosing_resources.  So the resources will be loaded at the point
  where resources_controller_for is specified.  However, it only adds the
  filter if it's not already there - so you can play around with the order if
  you need to:
  
    prepend_before_filter :load_enclosing_resources
    resources_controller_for :foos
  
  (common case for the above is where superclass defines filters that need 
  access to enclosing resources)

* resources_controller_for can now be specified more than once in a controller 
  hierarchy.  The latter definition will overwrite the previous one, and will 
  also 'reset' the nestings.

* First stab at namespace support:
  map.namespace :admin do |admin|
    admin.resources :forums
  end
  
  module Admin
    module Forums < ApplicationController
      resources_controller_for :forums
    end
  end

  in an action:
    resources_path # => '/admin/forums'
    enclosing_resources # => []

* Minor doc improvements
  Speced better js response on edit and new actions [Jason Lee <jlsync@gmail.com>]

* The Routing patch has been removed from RC as it has been accepted and applied to edge (#8930).
  This is not a dependency of RC, but it is of the specs - so grab latest edge to run them.

* Major internal changes, and some API change: see the rdoc for details.
  The headlines:
   - load_enclosing is now true by default
   - BC: the old options work for now, but you'll get deprecation messages
   - refactored a lot of code into friend classes - in particular there is now
     ResourcesController::Specification which specifies how to find a resource from the route

* Fixed some problems with internals of RC when :load_enclosing => true

* resources_controller now supports singleton resources!  and much better :load_enclosing support
  Booya! =>
    class TagsController < ApplicationController
      resources_controller_for :tags, :load_enclosing => true
    end
    
    this will service all these routes (loading the resources into assigns for the view)
    
      /tags
      /forums/2/tags
      /images/1/tags
      /home/tags          <= singular resource
      /users/1/image/tags <= nested singular resource 
  
    Also
    
    class BlogController < ApplicationController
      resources_controller_for :blog, :singleton => true, :load_enclosing => true
    end
    
    class PostController < ApplicationController
      resources_controller_for :post, :load_enclosing => true
    end
    
    for /campaigns/1/blog
        /users/2/blog
        /campaigns/1/blog/posts
        /users/2/blog/posts
        
        etc...
  
  TODO: rewrite docs - for now check out the spec suite.
  TODO: refactor code - I did it BDD stylee, so there's lots of specs but also a lot of code that 'is the simplest thing that makes the specs pass'

* resources_request has changed format - it now returns an array like this
  [ {:name => "forums", :name_prefix => "forum_", :key => :forum_id, :id => "1"}, {:name => "posts"}]
  Singular resources are detected properly (see spec/specs/resources_controller_spec for some tests).
  This paves the way for singular_resource support, and better 'many routes/one controller' support
  
  Decided that Patching Routing was a bad idea, so route is re-recognized using the request path.  This
  only happens for controllers with :load_enclosing => true

* You can now call methods such as enclosing_resource_path, enclosing_resources_path, etc 
  in your controller and view and the correct url helper will be called.  These url_helpers are defined
  as they are needed, so it's pretty fast.
  
* Removing routing decoration for now

* Enclosing resources are now all loaded by one method :load_enclosing which is a prepend_before_filter.
  This means that you can access the enclosing resources in all before_filters, even when a subclass adds
  more nestings.
  
  Example:
  
    class PostsController < ApplicationController
      resources_controller_for :posts
    end
    
    class UserPostsController < PostsController
      nested_in :user
      
      before_filter {|c| raise 'boom' if @user.name == 'Santa'}
    end
  
* Removed ResourceService proxy class.  This was mainly used for BC with rails <= 1.2.2.  If you're
  using this, then freeze to r377 of resources_controller.  The resource_service is now either an
  ActiveRecord or association proxy.
  
* Added route decoration to access the recognized route in the controller (for future parsing of
  singular resources, and better polymorphic support)

* Removed Ardes::ResourcesController::Spec::ViewHelper as it's best to not have a dependency
  like this in your specs.  Just stub out the resource methods that are needed by that view,
  or use the default assigns. 

* Named path support is much improved.  All named routes for the current resource can be
  called by substituting 'resource'.  E.g. the following methods in your controller or
  view will work: :formatted_resource_path, :preview_resource_path (if :preview is in :member),
  :resource_tags_path, etc, etc.
  This helps with decoupling the model name from the controller and view.

* Added flash tests [frederikfix at eml dot cc]

* Added rjs actions [frederikfix at eml dot cc]

* Added Ardes::ResourcesController::Spec::ViewHelper for easy view testing

* Added Helper#form_for_resource for easy form generation, see rdoc for details

* Enclosed named paths use the new edge rails conventions for named routes.

  So to get the path to edit a child tag resource (where resource is 'forum:1')
    edit_resource_tag_path(@tag) # => '/forums/1/tags/2/edit'

* Handles options passed to named routes
  
    resource_path(:sort_by => 'article') # => '/forums/2?sort_by=article'

* Now handles enclosing named paths.  You can reference named routes that are
  'below' (or enclosed by) the current resource by appending resource_ to that
  named route. [thanks Chris Hapgood for the initial idea]

* (find|new)_resource(s) methods are now defined by resources_controller_for only
  if they do not already exist

* Better regexp for resources_request [Chris Hapgood]

* Added more specs to get coverage to 100%

* Upgraded to rpsec 0.9, improved Rakefile and specs so that spec:plugins will work

* Removed ApplicationController from spec/app.rb to avoid conflicts with en-
  closing rails application

* Added method_missing proxy to ResourceService, to enable the resource_service
  to be used for things other than find or new (for example Pagination) [Dan Kubb]

* Fixed small error in flash message of destroy action [Dan Kubb]

* Removing experimental cruft

* CHANGELOG started
