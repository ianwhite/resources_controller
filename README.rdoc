= resources_controller

is a plugin to facilitate inheritance and DRYness in your resources controllers.  It introduces some abstraction to help
you override the default RESTful funtionality in a clean and simple manner.

See History.txt for recent changes.

== Why this fork?

We need to make a few changes to the pre Rails 3.1 and above version of this gem, to make it play a bit nicer with Ruby 1.9.3.

== Rails 3 version

Add this to your Gemfile

  gem 'resources_controller', :git => 'git://github.com/ianwhite/resources_controller'

Or install as a plugin

  rails plugin install git://github.com/ianwhite/resources_controller
