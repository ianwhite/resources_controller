= rest_controller

ActionController extension to facilitate inheritance and DRYness in your rest controllers

Simple Usage (see Ardes::ResourcesController for more)

  class ThingsController < ApplicationController
    resources_controller_for :things
  end

Also supports nested resources

  class CommentsController < ApplicationController
    resources_controller_for :comments, :in => [:forum, :post]
  end

=== Specs and Coverage
* {SPECDOC}[link:files/SPECDOC.html] lists the specifications
* {RSpec Report}[link:rspec_report.html] is a report of spec pass/fails
* {RCov Report}[link:coverage/index.html] is the rcov report

=== Dependencies
* <tt>RCov</tt>               To install do: <tt>gem install rcov</tt>
* <tt>RSpec</tt>              To install do: <tt>gem install rspec</tt>
* <tt>rspec rails plugin</tt> see http://rspec.rubyforge.org/documentation/rails/install.html

=== Testing
RSpec is used for testing, so the tests are in <tt>spec/</tt> rather than
<tt>test/</tt> To run the tests you need a test database set up,
edit <tt>spec/database.yml</tt> to provide the details.

=== Rake tasks
The following tasks are defined:

* <tt>rspec</tt>      (the default task) run the specs
* <tt>rcov</tt>       generate a coverage report (in doc/coverage)
* <tt>rspec_rdoc</tt> generate an rdoc formatted spec doc (in SPECDOC)
* <tt>rspec_rep</tt>  generate a html report of passing/failing test cases (in doc/rspec_report.html)
* <tt>rdoc</tt>       generate the docs, (including SPECDOC)
* <tt>rdoc_all</tt>   generate all documentation including coverage and rspec report
