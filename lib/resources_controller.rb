# With resources_controller you can quickly add
# an ActiveResource compliant controller for your your RESTful models.
# 
# = Examples
# Here are some examples - for more on how to use  RC go to the Usage section at the bottom,
# for syntax head to resources_controller_for
#
# ==== Example 1: Super simple usage
# Here's a simple example of how it works with a Forums has many Posts model:
# 
#   class ForumsController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :forums
#   end
#
# Your controller will get the standard CRUD actions, @forum will be set in member actions, @forums in
# index.
# 
# ==== Example 2: Specifying enclosing resources
#   class PostsController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :posts, :in => :forum
#   end
#
# As above, but the controller will load @forum on every action, and use @forum to find and create @posts
#
# ==== Wildcard enclosing resources
# All of the above examples will work for any routes that match what it specified
#
#              PATH                     RESOURCES CONTROLLER WILL DO:
#
#  Example 1  /forums                   @forums = Forum.find(:all)
#
#             /users/2/forums           @user = User.find(2)
#                                       @forums = @user.forums.find(:all)
#
#  Example 2  /posts                    This won't work as the controller specified
#                                       that :posts are :in => :forum
#
#             /forums/2/posts           @forum = Forum.find(2)
#                                       @posts = @forum.posts.find(:all)
#
#             /sites/4/forums/3/posts   @site = Site.find(4)
#                                       @forum = @site.forums.find(3)
#                                       @posts = @forum.posts.find(:all)
#
#             /users/2/posts/1          This won't work as the controller specified
#                                       that :posts are :in => :forum
#                                       
#
# It is up to you which routes to open to the controller (in config/routes.rb).  When
# you do, RC will use the route segments to drill down to the specified resource.  This means
# that if User 3 does not have Post 5, then /users/3/posts/5 will raise a RecordNotFound Error.
# You dont' have to write any extra code to do this oft repeated controller pattern.
#
# With RC, your route specification flows through to the controller - no need to repeat yourself.
#
# If you don't want to have RC match wildcard resources just pass :load_enclosing => false
#
#   resources_controller_for :posts, :in => :forum, :load_enclosing => false
#
# ==== Example 3: Singleton resource
# Here's an example of a singleton, the account pattern that is so common.
#
#   class AccountController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :account, :class => User, :singleton => true do
#       @current_user
#     end
#   end
#
# Your controller will use the block to find the resource.  The @account will be assigned to @current_user
#
# ==== Example 4: Allowing PostsController to be used all over
# First thing to do is remove :in => :forum
#
#   class PostsController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :posts
#   end
#
# This will now work for /users/2/posts.
#
# ==== Example 4 and a bit: Mapping non standard resources
# How about /account/posts?  The account is found in a non standard way - RC won't be able
# to figure out how tofind it if it appears in the route.  So we give it some help.
#
# (in PostsController)
#
#   map_enclosing_resource :account, :singleton => true, :class => User, :find => :current_user
# 
# Now, if :account apears in any part of a route (for PostsController) it will be mapped to
# (in this case) the current_user method of teh PostsController.
#
# To make the :account mapping available to all, just chuck it in ApplicationController
# 
# This will work for any resource which can't be inferred from its route segment name
#
#   map_enclosing_resource :users, :segment => :peeps, :key => 'peep_id'
#   map_enclosing_resource :posts, :class => OddlyNamedPostClass
#
# ==== Example 5: Singleton association
# Here's another singleton example - one where it corresponds to a has_one or belongs_to association
#
#   class ImageController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :image, :singleton => true
#   end
#
# When invoked with /users/3/image RC will find @user, and use @user.image to find the resource, and
# @user.build_image, to create a new resource. 
#
# ==== Example 6: :resource_path (equivalent resource path): aliasing a named route to a RESTful route
#
# You may have a named route that maps a url to a particular controller and action,
# this causes resources_controller problems as it relies on the route to load the
# resources.  You can get around this by specifying :resource_path as a param in routes.rb
#
#   map.root :controller => :forums, :action => :index, :resource_path => '/forums'
#
# When the controller is invoked via the '' url, rc will use :resource_path to recognize the
# route.
#
# This is only necessary if you have wildcard enclosing resources enabled (the default)
#
# ==== Putting it all together
#
# An exmaple app
#
# config/routes.rb:
#  
#  map.resource :account do |account|
#    account.resource :image
#    account.resources :posts
#  end
#
#  map.resources :users do |user|
#    user.resource :image
#    user.resources :posts
#  end
#
#  map.resources :forums do |forum|
#    forum.resources :posts
#    forum.resource :image
#  end
#
#  map.root :controller => :forums, :action => :index, :resource_path => '/forums'
#
# app/controllers:
#
#  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
#    map_enclosing_resource :account, :singleton => true, :find => :current_user
#
#    def current_user # get it from session or whatnot
#  end
#
#  class ForumsController < AplicationController
#    resources_controller_for :forums
#  end
#    
#  class PostsController < AplicationController
#    resources_controller_for :posts
#  end
#
#  class UsersController < AplicationController
#    resources_controller_for :users
#  end
#
#  class ImageController < AplicationController
#    resources_controller_for :image, :singleton => true
#  end
#
#  class AccountController < ApplicationController
#    resources_controller_for :account, :singleton => true, :find => :current_user
#  end
#
# This is how the app will handle the following routes:
#
#  PATH                   CONTROLLER    WHICH WILL DO:
#  
#  /forums                forums        @forums = Forum.find(:all)
#  
#  /forums/2/posts        posts         @forum = Forum.find(2)
#                                       @posts = @forum.forums.find(:all)
#
#  /forums/2/image        image         @forum = Forum.find(2)
#                                       @image = @forum.image   
#  
#  /image                       <no route>
#
#  /posts                       <no route>
#
#  /users/2/posts/3       posts         @user = User.find(2)
#                                       @post = @user.posts.find(3)
#  
#  /users/2/image POST    image         @user = User.find(2)
#                                       @image = @user.build_image(params[:image])
#
#  /account               account       @account = self.current_user
#
#  /account/image         image         @account = self.current_user
#                                       @image = @account.image
#
#  /account/posts/3 PUT   posts         @account = self.current_user
#                                       @post = @account.posts.find(3)
#                                       @post.update_attributes(params[:post])
#
# === Views
#
# Ok - so how do I write the views?  
#
# For most cases, just in exactly the way you would expect to.  RC sets the instance variables
# to what they should be.
#
# But, in some cases, you are going to have different variables set - for example
#
#   /users/1/posts    =>  @user, @posts
#   /forums/2/posts   =>  @forum, @posts
# 
# Here are some options (all are appropriate for different circumstances):
# * test for the existence of @user or @forum in the view, and display it differently
# * have two different controllers UserPostsController and ForumPostsController, with different views
#   (and direct the routes to them in routes.rb)
# * use enclosing_resource - which always refers to the... immediately enclosing resource.
#
# Using the last technique, you might write your posts index as follows
# (here assuming that both Forum and User have .name)
#
#   <h1>Posts for <%= link_to enclosing_resource_path, "#{enclosing_resource_name.humanize}: #{enclosing_resource.name}" %></h1>
#
#   <%= render :partial => 'post', :collection => @posts %>
#
# Notice *enclosing_resource_name* - this will be something like 'user', or 'post'.
# Also *enclosing_resource_path* - in RC you get all of the named route helpers relativised to the current resource
# and enclosing_resource.  See NamedRouteHelper for more details.
#
# This can useful when writing the _post partial:
#
#   <p>
#     <%= post.name %>
#     <%= link_to 'edit', edit_resource_path(tag) %>
#     <%= link_to 'destroy', resource_path(tag), :method => :delete %>
#   </p>
#
# when viewed at /users/1/posts it will show
#
#  <p>
#    Cool post
#    <a href="/users/1/posts/1/edit">edit</a>
#    <a href="js nightmare with /users/1/posts/1">delete</a>
#  </p>
#  ...
#
# when viewd at /forums/1/posts it will show
#
#  <p>
#    Other post
#    <a href="/forums/1/posts/3/edit">edit</a>
#    <a href="js nightmare with /forums/1/posts/3">delete</a>
#  </p>
#  ...
#
# This is like polymorphic urls, except that RC will just use whatever enclosing resources are loaded to generate the urls/paths.
#
# = Usage
# To use RC, there are just three class methods on controller to learn.
#
# resources_controller_for <name>, <options>, <&block>
#
# ClassMethods#nested_in <name>, <options>, <&block>
#
# map_enclosing_resource <name>, <options>, <&block>
#
# === Customising finding and creating
# If you want to implement something like query params you can override *find_resources*.  If you want to change the 
# way your new resources are created you can override *new_resource*.
#
#   class PostsController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :posts
# 
#     def find_resources
#       resource_service.find :all, :order => params[:sort_by]
#     end
#
#     # you can call super to help yourself to the existing implementation
#     def new_resource
#       super.tap {|r| r.ip_address = request.ip_address }
#     end
#
# In the same way, you can override *find_resource*.
#
# === Writing controller actions
#
# You can make use of RC internals to simplify your actions.
#
# Here's an example where you want to re-order an acts_as_list model.  You define a class method
# on the model (say *order_by_ids* which takes and array of ids).  You can then make use of *resource_service*
# (which makes use of awesome rails magic) to send correctly scoped messages to your models.
#
# Here's how to write an order action
#
#   def order
#     resource_service.order_by_ids["things_order"]
#   end
#
# the route
#
#   map.resources :things, :collection => {:order => :put}
#
# and the view can conatin a scriptaculous drag and drop with param name 'things_order'
#
# When this controller is invoked of /things the :order_by_ids message will be sent to the Thing class,
# when it's invoked by /foos/1/things, then :order_by_ids message will be send to Foo.find(1).things association
#
# === using non standard ids
#
# Lets say you want to set to_param to login, and use find_by_login
# for your users in your URLs, with routes as follows:
#
#   map.reosurces :users do |user|
#     user.resources :addresses
#   end
#
# First, the users controller needs to find reosurces using find_by_login
#
#   class UsersController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :users
#
#   protected
#     def find_resource(id = params[:id])
#       resource_service.find_by_login(id)
#     end
#   end
#
# This controller will find users (for editing, showing, and destroying) as
# directed.  (this controller will work for any route where user is the
# last resource, including the /users/dave route)
#
# Now you need to specify that the user as enclosing resource needs to be found
# with find_by_login.  For the addresses case above, you would do this:
#
#   class AddressesController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :addresses
#     nested_in :user do
#       User.find_by_login(params[:user_id])
#     end
#   end
#
# If you wanted to open up more nested resources under user, you could repeat
# this specification in all such controllers, alternatively, you could map the
# resource in the ApplicationController, which would be usable by any controller
#
# If you know that user is never nested (i.e. /users/dave/addresses), then do this:
#
#   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
#     map_enclosing_resource :user do
#       User.find(params[:user_id])
#     end
#   end
#
# or, if user is sometimes nested (i.e. /forums/1/users/dave/addresses), do this:
#
#     map_enclosing_resource :user do
#       ((enclosing_resource && enclosing_resource.users) || User).find(params[:user_id])
#     end
#
# Your Addresses controller will now be the very simple one, and the resource map will
# load user as specified when it is hit by a route /users/dave/addresses.
#
#   class AddressesController < ApplicationController
#     resources_controller_for :addresses
#   end
#
module ResourcesController
  mattr_accessor :actions, :singleton_actions
  self.actions = ResourcesController::Actions
  self.singleton_actions = ResourcesController::SingletonActions
  
  def self.extended(base)

      class_attribute :resource_specification_map
      self.resource_specification_map = {}
    end
  end
  
  # Specifies that this controller is a REST style controller for the named resource
  #
  # Enclosing resources are loaded automatically by default, you can turn this off with
  # :load_enclosing (see options below)
  #
  # resources_controller_for <name>, <options>, <&block>
  #
  # ==== Options:
  # * <tt>:singleton:</tt> (default false) set this to true if the resource is a Singleton
  # * <tt>:find:</tt> (default null) set this to a symbol or Proc to specify how to find the resource.
  #   Use this if the resource is found in an unconventional way.  Passing a block has the same effect as
  #   setting :find => a Proc
  # * <tt>:in:</tt> specify the enclosing resources, by name.  ClassMethods#nested_in can be used to 
  #   specify this more fully.
  # * <tt>:load_enclosing:</tt> (default true) loads enclosing resources automatically.
  # * <tt>:actions:</tt> (default nil) set this to false if you don't want the default RC actions.  Set this
  #   to a module to use that module for your own actions.
  # * <tt>:only:</tt> only include the specified actions.
  # * <tt>:except:</tt> include all actions except the specified actions.
  #
  # ===== Options for unconvential use
  # (otherwise these are all inferred from the _name_)
  # * <tt>:route:</tt> the route name (without name_prefix) if it can't be inferred from _name_.
  #   For a collection resource this should be plural, for a singleton it should be singular.
  # * <tt>:source:</tt> a string or symbol (e.g. :users, or :user).  This is used to find the class or association name
  # * <tt>:class:</tt> a Class.  This is the class of the resource (if it can't be inferred from _name_ or :source)
  # * <tt>:segment:</tt> (e.g. 'users') the segment name in the route that is matched
  #
  # === The :in option
  # The default behavior is to set up before filters that load the enclosing resource, and to use associations on
  # that model to find and create the resources.  See ClassMethods#nested_in for more details on this, and
  # customising the default behaviour.
  # 
  # === load_enclosing_resources
  # By default, a before_filter is added by resources_controller called :load_enclosing_resources - which
  # does all the work of loading the enclosing resources.  You can use ActionControllers standard filter
  # mechanisms to control when this filter is invoked.  For example - you can choose not to load resources
  # on an action
  #
  #   resources_controller_for :foos
  #   skip_before_filter :load_enclosing_resources, :only => :static_page
  #
  # Or, you can change the order of when the filter is invoked by adding the filter call yourself (rc will
  # only add the filter if it doesn't exist)
  #
  #   before_filter :do_something
  #   prepend_before_filter :load_enclosing_resources
  #   resources_controller_for :foos
  #   before_filter :do_something_else     # chain => [:load_enclosing_resources, :do_something, :do_something_else]
  #
  # === Default actions module
  # If you have your own actions module you prefer to use other than the standard resources_controller ones
  # you can set ResourcesController.actions to that module to have this be included by default
  #
  #   ResourcesController.actions = MyAwesomeActions
  #   ResourcesController.singleton_actions = MyAweseomeSingletonActions
  #
  #   class AwesomenessController < ApplicationController
  #     resources_controller_for :awesomenesses # includes MyAwesomeActions by default

Can't get singleton resource from class #{klass.name}. You have have probably done something like:

nested_in :#{name}, :singleton => true  # <= where this is the first nested_in

You should tell resources_controller how to find the singleton resource like this:

nested_in :#{name}, :singleton => true do
  #{klass.name}.find(<.. your find args here ..>)
end

Or: 
nested_in :#{name}, :singleton => true, :find => <.. method name or lambda ..>

Or, you may be relying on the route to load the resource, in which case you need to give RC some
help.  Do this by mapping the route segment to a resource in the controller, or a parent or mixin

map_enclosing_resource :#{name}, :segment => ..., :singleton => true <.. as above ..>
